# Delivery-Dash
This is my A-Level project.
It is going to be a game where the player races agaisnt an AI to deliver all parcels the fastest.
The AI is going to be a NEAT algorithm that learns to delvier all the parcels in the best way. Then that Neural Net is saved and loaded into the game when the player wants to race it.
